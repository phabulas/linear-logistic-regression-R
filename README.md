 #Linear and Logistic Regression in R

This repository contains two RMarkdown notebooks showcasing regression modeling on real-world datasets. The goal is to practice and demonstrate basic predictive modeling workflows in R, with clear and reproducible steps.

## Contents

- **linear_regression.Rmd**: Linear regression analysis of the California Housing dataset (`home.txt`), including:
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Baseline linear regression
  - Polynomial features for model improvement
  - Residual analysis and model diagnostics

- **logistic_regression.Rmd**: Logistic regression analysis of firm-level data (`efige.txt`), including:
  - Model specification and variable selection
  - Interpretation of coefficients and odds ratios
  - Model fit evaluation
  - Visualization of predicted probabilities

## Data

- `data/home.txt`: California housing data with house prices and features
- `data/efige.txt`: Firm-level data with variables on innovation, trade, ownership, etc.
